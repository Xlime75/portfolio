            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Asher Daniel Magaling Tibayan or you can call me Asher, a passionate BSIT student at ST. Dominic College Of Asia. 
             I have a keen interest in Games, Ai, programming, and web/app development. I am always eager to learn new things. Here's a little more about my journey:</p>
             I completed my first year of college at FEU Tech, I've taken the course of Computer Science with specialization of Software Engineering. 
             Over there I learned the C++ language, I together with my group developed a "taxation calculator" for our final project in one of my subjects.
             I have always believed that taking breaks is also part of learning so I always give myself time to take a break and relax.
             During my time to relax I usually just play online games like Valorant and CS2. I also play guitar and learn more about computer.
             In my continuous growth, I'm always trying to improve myself by learning more about programming. </p>

            <p>
            As I continue my journey in the IT field, I aspire to become a skilled programmer, software developer or game developer who creates innovative and helpful applications. 
            In the future, I hope to work with a team of professionals in a tech company where I can apply my skills in programming and AI.
            I also hope to work in a company that will prioritize their employees and not abandon them when things gets rough.
            One of my goals is to build softwares, apps and/or games that make everyday tasks easier or bring people joy.
            I also want to work in the AI field and create a AI similar to "Jarvis" that Tony Stark had.
            To achieve this, I am dedicated to constantly improving my coding skills and staying updated with the latest technologies.</p>

            <p>Feel free to look at my skills and the list of programming languages I know in the next section!</p>
